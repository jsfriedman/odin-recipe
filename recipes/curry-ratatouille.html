            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a recipe that Sarah and I put together ourselves, based on a country style ratatouille. Most folks are likely familiar with the dish from the movie <em>Ratatouille</em>,<br>
            however, the style of ratatouille shown in the movie is actually a different interpretation of the regular dish. The dish is typically a tomato stew with rough chopped vegetables.</p>

            <p>While already avid fans of making ratatouille, Sarah and I found a recipe in Ottolenghi's <u>Flavor</u> recipe book titled <em>Spicy Coconut Berbere Ratatouille</em> which really tickled our fancy.<br>
            We envisioned a cross between our beloved ratatouille tomato stew, and a spicy aromatic curry. The recipe, however, was nothing of the sort and we were left disappointed.</p>

            <p>After making the recipe as prescribed, we dusted ourselves off and went ahead and made a new recipe as we envisioned in our heads when we had first heard the original title. And here we are today.</p>
