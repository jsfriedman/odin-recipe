            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a recipe that Sarah and I put together ourselves, based on a country style ratatouille. Most folks are likely familiar with the dish from the movie <em>Ratatouille</em>,<br>
            however, the style of ratatouille shown in the movie is actually a different interpretation of the regular dish. The dish is typically a tomato stew with rough chopped vegetables.</p>

            <p>While already avid fans of making ratatouille, Sarah and I found a recipe in Ottolenghi's <u>Flavor</u> recipe book titled <em>Spicy Coconut Berbere Ratatouille</em> which really tickled our fancy.<br>
            We envisioned a cross between our beloved ratatouille tomato stew, and a spicy aromatic curry. The recipe, however, was nothing of the sort and we were left disappointed.</p>

            <p>After making the recipe as prescribed, we dusted ourselves off and went ahead and made a new recipe as we envisioned in our heads when we had first heard the original title. And here we are today.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat. Pour enough in to liberally coat vegetables. I typically pour a solid layer in at the beginning so I don't have to add more as I go</li>
                <li>Chop onions to preferred size. After all, this <em>is</em> supposed to be a rustic soup, and sautee onions until translucent around the edges</li>
                <li>Chop garlic and add to onions. Sautee for 30 seconds, make sure not to burn the garlic</li>
                <li>Add tomato paste and cook for another 60 seconds</li>
                <li>Chop both zucchini and eggplant(s) into quarter rounds</li>
                <li>Sautee zucchini and eggplant for a few minutes until they being to soften</li>
                <li>Chop tomatoes and add to pot</li>
                <li>Add herb de provence, salt, pepper, and berbere</li>
                <li>Simmer with lid on but cracked for at least 45 minutes, the tomatoes need to break down to form the broth of the stew. The longer you can simmer this dish for, the better</li>
                <li>When the simmering is down, add the coconut milk and stir thoroughly to mix. Add a final dash of berbere to the dish, as fresh berbere and simmered berbere have their own distinct flavors</li>
                <li>Eat on its own, or over any starchy base</li>
            </ol>
